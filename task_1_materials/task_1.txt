Given the student-mat.csv file in the attachment, please make a prediction about whether the student will pass or not in the final exam and prepare a contingency table to summarize the classification performance.

It is necessary and sufficient to get at least 10 points from the G3 grade to pass.
Your prediction should rely on posterior probability calculation using the Bayes Theorem.
You're expected to use at least two categorical features in the dataset to decide on the class.
You can use 80% of the data as training and compute posterior probabilities on that part, then 20% can be used to test the prediction performance.
You're provided a code sample that reads features from an input file, makes a simple prediction, and constructs a contingency table for summarizing the prediction performance.
